# Giphy

**Instructions**

In this application, the user will be able to select the default emotions (happy, sad and angry) that will all display gifs related to the type of emotion. 

To add an emotion, the user will enter in the input field. This will then create a button labeled with their search.

If the user clicks the button they create, the most relevant gifs will appear associated with that emotion.

Once the page is refreshed, the page will default back to the the three original default emotions.
